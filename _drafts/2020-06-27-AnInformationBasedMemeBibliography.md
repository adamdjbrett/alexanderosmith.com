## A Brief Intro: Y Tho?
Chances are, if you are reading this, it is for one of a few reasons. Firstly, you just like reading my blog. (Hahahaha!) Secondly, you might have an interest in _memetics_, or memes as a subject of study, and you are curious where to start. Thirdly, you found your current research interest is related to memes, but you don't have time for a serious survey of the literature. Finally — and I think this is my hope — you define your interests in relation to Information Science and you are inspired by Evolutionary Cultural Studies, but you have found the overlap in Information Science and Evolutionary Cultural Theory wanting. If any of these apply to you, I believe this briefly annotated bibliography is of use to you.

This said, this is not the first attempt at a survey or a review of memetic literature. There have been many past outlines worth considering with a variety of interests in mind. As such, some things here will correspond with those outlines. However, here, I wish to be particular to Information Studies' interests. As such, the arrangement of topics here will be unique to any annotated bibliography, survey, or review of memetic literature to at the point of writing. I would also like to point out that this will likely be updated over time. This is not a final draft.

For those interested in a more recent outline of memetics that is situated more in line with recent memetics, consider . This article is more in accordance with where memetics situates itself now. In particular, it is more oriented towards the areas of Communciation and Media Studies, which is the primary spaces for memetics at present. However memes have only been considered regularly in Communication and Media Studies from approximately 2010 till the present. From my reading, recent memetic study does not do offer previous disciplines and previous history of memetic study justice.

Memetics initially was invested in evolutionary culture, and as such was a part of a larger set of of theories of evolutionary culture in cultural anthropology. In fact, there was a journal dedicated to memetics from 1997 to 2005. As this was only a yearly publication and it is openly accessible now. It is possible to read the entire journal in a brief period of time. While it is very dated, it is still important to understanding the "first wave" of memetics. That said, aside for purely historical reasons, I do not suggest reading the entire journal. Instead I would suggest reading this document first. Then reading a few of the documents listed here. Then after that, skim through the _Journal of Memetics_' [overview](http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/overview.html) and [bibliography](http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/biblio/) for anything that seems particularly interesting.

While there have been attempts by others to create literature overviews of memetics, they are integrated into books that will be considered here for different reasons, or they are severely limited or dated. At one point, memetics was considered to be the beginnings of a "field" of study. That is to say, for a moment in the late 1990s, memetics teased at having a general theory of evolutionary culture that stemmed from a biological analogy. But it became clear by the early 2000s that it was not yet ready as was marked by the disbanding of the _Journal of Memetics_ in 2005. From about 2005 till 2008, I would argue there was a severe lack of publication in memetics in which a few Communication scholars decided to turn it into a Internet study. Since then, memetics has been considered for field specific interests in a variety of spaces, most commonly Internet and Digital Communication and Rhetoric. However in my opinion, much of this "second-wave" of memetics has lost sight of the theoretical goals of memetics, but rather find memes to be a useful alternative way to study groups of digital artifacts or documents.

This bibliography is arranged such that an informationally centered student of memetics might find inspiration to see memes as more than another way to study popular communication online. This is a part of a greater project to re-align memetics with its previous evolutionary spirit, but this time, within Information Studies. In doing so, I will be taking some liberties in deciding what is important for memetics to move forward. This is a blog post after all, but that said, if you have similar interests in mind, the memetics is not quite ready for an "information" oriented survey of memes. This takes liberties because it is speculating on the important things to come for a particular orientation of memetics that has not quite happened yet: a memetic "third wave."

## Meme Canon?
I will start with some indisputable works that anyone who writes on memes should know. In my reading, its surprising how many do not know these. That said, I set up my Google Scholar alerts to notify me of any mention of the words "meme" or "memetics" and I get all of them. It is notable, that if the following are not at least mentioned, they do not seem to have a good reception. There are some serious red flags if a scholar does not answer to the following canon documents in their work.
