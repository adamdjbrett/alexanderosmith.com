## Memes and Movements

Memes move through time. If they are these bits of culture that spread, across experiences, they certainly move through time. I could also reference to digital space, as Shifman does definitionally [^1], when referring to memes traversing through platform to platform. While one might see this spacially, it is somewhat of an abstraction of our senses of memes. For simplicity here, let's focus on the time-scale of memetics which is more grounded in our cognition.

When scrolling through the internet or moving from one platform to another, this is more interpretable as time passing than movements through space. It is fair to ultimately argue that the internet and the physical infrastructures which build them are spacialized across servers and screen pixels' distances from each other. However, putting this aside for the moment, enables me to say something somewhat interesting about how memes become culturally embodied, and how this is somewhat joined to and differentiated from particularly spacial media: comics.

So for now, memetic "movements" here are time oriented more so than spacial.

## Between Gutters and Rivers

Intuitively, visual internet memes are not too far away from existing like comics do. By comparison much of the same language Scott McCloud applies to comics can be applied to visual memes almost directly.[^2] Visual memes are collections of images, much as comics are. Between these images there are connections which signify the passage of time, a movement needed to get from one moment to the next. Across them, we imagine the action. Between them, the stitches of a narrative or a meaning are pulled together. In comics, when we see the stitch, it's called a "panel," but when the narrative seam disappears behind the page, it leaves a gap between panels called a "gutter."

The "gutter" is where the invisible can be seen in two ways. The first way is within the page itself. As a seam, the thread must be there by physical necessity or else one image following from the next would be too much to assume. Since they clearly do, the seam exists inside the medium of the page itself. The page itself enables a connection from one moment to the next. The second way is by the narrative power of the viewer. As McCloud says, "Here in the limbo of the gutter, *human imagination* takes two separate images and *transforms* them into a single idea." ([^2] p. 66). The viewer must make the cinema, the potentials of time, themselves. We make the virtuality of the gutter real. It is in these two ways, the seam is a multiplexed informational channel which is visible to us as a "gutter."

For the comic strip, of course, this is modern, mechanical information flow. The system is a well glossed, illustrated, and stabled together contractual narrative agreement between the authors and the reader. The seam leaves little space by pulling the gutter taught and neat. The narrative is just as tight or loose as the author designed for the page. This leaves an intentionally limiting gutter offering the reader just enough material to play with. Information flows in parallel with the seam by the author. However it also flows parallel with the gutter and orthogonal to the narrative seam. Where those two flows meet, an idea forms at the cross.

But what happens when there is no mechanic to draw the contract for the viewer? The medium is no longer industrial production between the printed narrative and limited "human imagination." The gutter becomes the virtual itself, a flowing river in all directions. No longer is the gutter designed between two images, but rather its a river which erodes and builds its own two banks of the past and the future. The images are no longer authored and sewn together by the modernly contracted individuals who supply and demand a narrative. The narrative is joined together by the river of potential itself connecting the banks it finds itself between.

It is here that memetics is different from comics. Agency is no longer contractual designs of media and human. Agency is post-human. Memetics individuates information for us. It puts life into mechanistic communication and controlled mediation. In memetics the gutter becomes a river with a life of its own. As Dawkins[^3] and Wilkins[^4] put it, memes demand to be seen as akin to organisms themselves.

## Seeing the Flood

While such extended metaphors are poetic, in this case, it is not simply theoretical pandering. Such an informational flood is one which can be empirically seen despite being understudied. However, it is understudied because of its difficulty in being seen by all people in decidedly systematically analogous ways. Consider the informational "flood" that James Gleick attributes to the meme: "[A]n object is not a meme. The hula hoop is not a meme; it is made of plastic, not of bits. When this species of toy spread worldwide in a mad epidemic in 1958, it was the product, the physical manifestation of a meme, or memes: the craving for hula hoops; the swaying, swinging, twirling skill set of hula-hooping. The hula hoop itself is a meme vehicle," ([^5] p. 313). For Gleick, the meme is not objective and lifeless. Upon having a hula hoop, a human is enabled to become some cyborg-ish connection between the two which is afforded by the human and hoop joining together, becoming "hula-hooping."

However, what "hula-hooping" is, requires potentials of action which are not defined by some modernist "gutter." Albeit, a hula hoop is, in fact, a product with a supposed contract for consumption in a similar way that comics are a contract between writer and reader. However, because the hula hoop is nothing more or less than a plastic ring of a specific size, the way in which it does its "swinging, twirling" and even bending or flipping is defined more by the action made possible between it and the body which uses it. The action between the hula hoop and the body which uses it creates the banks in which information's river can flood and reshape the hips of the hula, the banks of the river. And this, most certainly, is not entirely within the agency of the "author" of the hula hoop if we could even find a specific person to attribute its design to.

When the hoop was popularized in the "epidemic" of 1958 that Gleick mentions, this hoop was passed on to Wham-O by the husband of Joan Anderson. He took the idea from Joan, introduced it to a opportunist profiteer at Wham-O, and this profiteer decided to cut them both out. To some degree a hula hoop was westernized as an exercise object derived from the activities of indigenous peoples of Australia. In all actuality, between the connections of Joan, her husband, and Wham-O's Arthur "Spud" Melin in total or distinctly had no idea the history of the banks which the hula hoop connected. They just saw an opportunity for profit through limited uses as a toy or exercise equipment. To suggest that any or all of these people really understood every possible use case of a hula hoop would be assuming they understood every case of its use and the creative developments that arise from such uses. Such an assumption is absurd and "contractually" limited to the westernized notion of patents supposed by Wham-O. This does not come close to addressing the cultural appropriation necessary to dissect the "hula hoop" from its original intent and value to Australian indigenous peoples which, likely, even Joan did not understand.
