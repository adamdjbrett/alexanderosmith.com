## Is This Cinema?
To quote Gilles Deleuze from the beginning of _Cinema: The Movement-Image_, "The essence of a thing never appears at the outset, but in the middle, in the course of its development when its strength is assured."[^1] Deleuze is speaking about the metaphysics of cinematic experiences which differentiate themselves through time, the process which ultimately builds a crystalline idea of what a thing essentially is. But Deleuze was not speaking of merely film-mediated histories; he was speaking of the assemblages of all of mediated reality. As such, is not a _meme_ also a part of such a mediated experience? Is not memetics a cinema?

Richard Dawkins -- the man who coined the term "meme" -- might agree on the surface, but he would most certainly disagree with Deleuze's metaphysical project. They both concerned themselves with evolutionary properties of culture. To my knowledge, Deleuze never addressed memetics himself. This perhaps was intentional. Dawkins proposed a positivistic paradigm of evolutionary biology that, without question, reshaped the way biologists discussed genes. Deleuze, being a sort of Henri Bergsonian metaphysician, most certainly would never align with genetic evolutionary metaphysics. He was more philosophically "empiricist" in his epistemology and would never have aligned with positivism.

Nevertheless, they both shared an interest with evolution of culture. For Dawkins, this was made clear in when he coined the term "meme"[^2] and went on to lead the field of memetics until the turn of the millennium when he grew frustrated with the project being "hijacked" by what has become understood as "Internet memetics." Deleuze was more interested in developing neo-Spinozian metaphysics and was known for redeveloping historical philosophers and aesthetics to develop these claims in order to provide a non-linear, anti-individualist perspective of time and cultural developments. As such, he would have absolutely never have been concerned with _The Selfish Gene_ which provides an individualist and neo-Platonic notion of how ideas spread as "forms" of biology and culture. Dawkins' theory lends itself to seeing genes and memes as biological and cultural production respectively, with undertones of capitalistic ideology. This has been a point of critique of his theory ever sense.

Yet, the "meme" of Dawkins account was hijacked by internet denizens' use of the term, as I mentioned. In turn, the meme was redeveloped from a theory that extended from neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory, to being a theory of mediated communication online. This differentiated from Dawkins' paradigm, and became known as "Internet memetics" research.[^3] The meme concept in of itself has evolved into several strains of thought. However, one thing that is known for certain, internet memes are now a part of everyone's online experience. Since Dawkins argues that the internet meme is not his meme, this means that "Internet memes" are more real than the conceptual theoretical framework that Dawkins provided for them.

This is to say, we have been provided a Deleuzian "middle" of memetics' development. Internet memes existence has been asserted and assured by everyday digital cultural life. However, that means we are currently "in the middle" of memetic development. Internet memetics has distanced itself from neo-Darwinian cultural research without a real evolutionary theoretical replacement. As such the new paradigm has less to do with "cultural evolution" and is more to do with a particular kind of information diffusion in digital space that is particularly conceptually hand-wavy and weasely. It has been so weasely that Knobel and Lankshear, who were early prominent researchers of internet memetics, suggested that contemporary internet memetics has completely stalled in clear theory development. Memetics revisits the goals of early memetic theory, it is destined to mean anything and everything and that it mostly seeks to affirm internet research goals more than develop a valuable theory in of itself.[^4]

As such, internet memetics is open to speculation in how it can reconnect itself to evolutionary culture studies. While some might argue that information diffusion itself is a kind of evolutionary culture, I have yet to see anyone synthesize this idea, and connect memetics to a clear development of this theory, nevermind the development of a clear scientific use-case of any such evolutionary theory. As such, I do not see a reason to accept any argument saying otherwise. 

The point of this essay is to forward a particular speculation about how a cultural evolutionary study can develop for internet memes, be that acceptable to the paradigm of internet memetics or not. To provide the speculation, I point to a salient example of "Loss" and surrounding contexts and history.
