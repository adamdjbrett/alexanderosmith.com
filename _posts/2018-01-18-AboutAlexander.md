# Research Biography

My current work focuses on the study of memes as a cultural heritage informatician. I have recieved a PhD from the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. My research is about information and technology studies and their connection to media, memory, and culture.

# Teaching

At Syracuse University, I have taught both undergraduate and graduate level data science courses as well as critical data courses. In the past, I have been a teaching assistant, tutor, and Supplemental Instruction Leader for various economics courses including Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, International Economics, Intermediate Microeconomics, and Macroeconomic Policy.

# Personal Life

I would say my life has been fairly eclectic. Despite primarily focusing on digital technologies in my research, my first job was as a farm hand in rural Georgia, just south of Appalachia. Then I was a temp worker for Sony Packaging, then I fell in love with barista/bartender work where I spent an aggregate of ~8 years and still cover shifts occasionally.

During the time that I was doing these jobs, I was also a high school or full-time university student. I began as an architecture major at Sourthern Polytechnic State University (since the sequester of 2013 in Georgia, this has become "Kennesaw State University - Marrietta Campus"). While there, it might be fair to say I spent more time playing progressive rock with my friend [Chris Bradley](https://www.instagram.com/chrisbradleyguitar/) (who is now a professional session musician) and founding tree climbing club. For insurance reasons, our tree climbing club had to be called a "cross country club." Additionally, for legal reasons, I christened this club "The Running Hornets that Run" because apparently "The Running Hornets" were already a SPSU club before us. A year after founding this club, I transferred to The University of West Georgia (UWG) and became an Economics major and an art minor. By the time I graduated at UWG, the Running Hornets that Run had apparently had gained the status of a full-fledged collegiate cross country team. So much for climbing trees, I guess.

After having completed my B.S. in Economics and a minor in Fine Art, I went on to do an M.A. in Economics at Georgia State while working in some pretty swanky coffee shops in Atlanta. If anyone remembers Octane (probably most famous for hiring the guy who's the face of the [Hipster Barista meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hipster-barista) or their product placement in the movie Baby Driver) I worked there briefly, but mostly I worked at Condesa and Java Vino. During my time at Georiga State, I decided to spend a lot of my time learning mathematics. Initially this was because of my interest in doing a PhD in Economics, however I very quickly decided I just liked mathematics theory. During my time in doing mathematics, I picked up a copy of Claude Shannon's _Mathematical Theory of Communication_ at about the same time as I picked up a copy of Thomas Kuhn's _Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ and decided that I wasn't quite as interested in economics as I was the way in which knowledge is developed as systems of noisy information transfers. Quickly, my M.A. advisor Paula Stephan realized that I was probably a better fit for Information Science, Science of Science, or Science and Technology Studies than I was "Economics of Science." This turned out to be life changing for me, and ultimately those "noisy information transfers" I theoretically generalized into what I call "memetics" now. So while my research may not show it, my trajectory of interest has almost always been an epistemology of dynamics of culture that began with a facination of Thomas Kuhn and Claude Shannon. Or as my parents might say, I am really good at making my distractions into academic trajectories.

During my time in academia, a good chunk of my time is about writing. During my MA, I got sucked into the common mathematics undergrad debate over which pens are best for mathematics notes. My two-cents? A good solid choice for lefties like myself are the Pilot Precise V5s although many of my right-handed friends continue to insist upon Pilot G-2s. They are wrong. Lefties know better than to choose a gel pen. However, with continued frustration with gel smears, paper pulp into roller balls, and lefty-angular tension destroying felt tips prematurely, I found myself entering the expensive habit of buying fountain pens. Counter-intuitively, fountain pens works great for lefties who carry around brass book darts. Those things can clean the nib of a fountain pen in less than second. My pickiness with writing tools has extended to keyboards, their firmware, word processors, and typesetters also! Occasoinally you might see me blog about some of these things beause I find them practical, but also because I find them facinating to think about as seemingly banal but highly interesting subjects that almost never get discussed in detail anymore outside of cultural heritage and digital humanities.

Speaking of, depsite being more involved in memes and their relation to information science and technology research, I've had a strong interest in niche online cultures and tinkering with computer hardware and open source operating systems. My peers have noticed I have an endearing relationship with half-functioning technologies. It might make more sense to say that I've always had a hacker-adjacent attitude, as would be expected for anyone from a farm family. (Ask any John Deere tractor owner about their position on "right-to-repair" if you don't believe me. You'll find that they are basically open-source software and hardware advocates. They tend to believe that things are only broken if they can't access what's wrong. As such, they would be just as quick to say most of our contemporary technologies are broken from the start because you can't tinker with them.) As such, many varieties of academic subjects related to hacker culture, open source development, development of networking technologies, technological reuse, simulation/emulation studies, video game studies, and even networked art that extends to histories before the internet have always facinated me.

Moving into the world of "fiction," I carry a special affinity for all things TRON, Blade Runner, Star Wars, and animation history. Speculative fiction is a special interest for me for lots of reasons. As a technological extension to that interest, I also love studying digital art, data art, and art pushing the boundaries between analogue and digital media. Although, it's not all "sci-fi" and "technology" for me. I have spent some time writing comedic fantasy fiction. While I have not been able to spend as much time doing so, I occasionally get the itch to write comedic fantasy: subtely blending the banal of existential reality into mystically exaggerated absurdities.
