# Research Biography

My current work focuses on the study of memes as a cultural heritage informatician. I have received a PhD from the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. My research is about information and technology studies and their connection to media, memory, and culture.

# Teaching

At Syracuse University, I have taught both undergraduate and graduate level data science courses as well as critical data courses. In the past, I have been a teaching assistant, tutor, and Supplemental Instruction Leader for various economics courses including Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, International Economics, Intermediate Microeconomics, and Macroeconomic Policy.

# How I Became An Academic

My life has been fairly eclectic for someone who made a career out of being a professional student. Despite primarily focusing on digital technologies in my research, my first job was about as disconnected from that world as it could be. I worked as a cattle farm hand in rural Georgia, just south of Appalachia. My second job was a brief moment as temp service worker for Sony Packaging before I fell in love with barista/bartender work. From 2011 until 2025, I have worked (on and off) about 8 years in drink service industry and still cover shifts occasionally.

During the time that I was doing these jobs, I was also a high school or full-time university student. As a university student, I began as an architecture major at Southern Polytechnic State University (now "Kennesaw State University - Marietta Campus"). While there, it might be fair to say I spent more time playing prog rock with my friend [Chris Bradley](https://www.instagram.com/chrisbradleyguitar/) (who is now a professional session musician), playing chess, and tree climbing in a club I co-founded. For insurance reasons, our tree climbing club had to be called a "cross country club." Additionally, for legal reasons, I named the club "The Running Hornets that Run" because apparently "The Running Hornets" were already an established club. But we were a "cross country club," hence the club's name. Eventually, the club did become more about cross country running than climbing trees. A year after founding this club, I transferred to The University of West Georgia (UWG) and became an Economics major and an art minor. By the time I graduated at UWG, the Running Hornets that Run gained the status of a full-fledged collegiate cross country team. So much for climbing trees, I guess.

After having completed my B.S. in Economics and a minor in Fine Art, I went on to do an M.A. in Economics at Georgia State while working in some pretty swanky coffee shops in Atlanta. If anyone remembers Octane (probably most famous for hiring the guy who's the face of the [Hipster Barista](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hipster-barista) meme or their product placement in the movie Baby Driver) I worked there briefly, but mostly I worked at Condesa, a third wave coffee shop and bar in Old Fourth Ward, and the historic JavaVino cafe and wine shop in Poncey-Highlands. 

During my time at Georgia State, I decided to spend a couple years dedicated to learning mathematics. Initially this was because of a pragmatic interest in pursuing PhD in Economics, however I quickly abandoned the more pragmatic aspects and fell in love more theoretical aspects of mathematics. Eventually, I found I liked mostly anything theory or philosophy related. Around that time, I picked up a copy of Claude Shannon's _Mathematical Theory of Communication_ at about the same time as I picked up a copy of Thomas Kuhn's _Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ and found a strong interest in how knowledge is developed across noisy information transfers of all kinds whether they are academic articles, citation networks, grants, digital images, interactions with technology, or even everyday objects in the world. My M.A. advisor, Paula Stephan, found herself explaining to me that despite my economics background, I had somehow managed to transform myself into an information scientist as some kind of science of science scholar or as a science and technology studies scholar without formal training. Despite her best attempts to guide me into becoming an "Economist of Science," she suggested I look into Information Science programs, which at the time did not exist in my home state of Georgia. I had never heard of an "iSchool" until then. This turned out to be a life changing realization for me. Ultimately those "noisy information transfers" theoretically generalized into what I called "memetics" in my dissertation. While my research may not show it, my trajectory of interest has almost always been an epistemology and the information dynamics of culture, starting from Thomas Kuhn and Claude Shannon and continues to propel me forward through a variety of other academic terms.

# Hobbies Outside of Academia (So Far)

In academia, a good chunk of my time is unsurprisingly spent writing. During my M.A., I got sucked into the common mathematics undergrad debate over which pens are best for mathematics notes. My two-cents? A good solid choice for lefties like myself are the Pilot Precise V5s although many of my right-handed friends continue to insist upon Pilot G-2s. They are wrong. Lefties know better than to choose a gel pen. With continued frustration with gel smears, paper pulp into roller balls, and lefty-angular tension destroying felt tips prematurely, I found myself in the frustratingly expensive hobby of fountain pens. Counter to what many fountain pen enthusiasts argue, fine and extra-fine nibbed fountain pens are an excellent writing solution for lefties who carry around brass book darts. Those things can clean the nib of a fountain pen in less than second, and with a well-designed nib and good writing form, a fountain pen is arguably the simplest solution to every handwritten writing problem I've ever had (except for occasionally losing them). My pickiness with writing tools has extended to keyboards, their firmware, word processors, and typesetters also! Occasionally, you might see me blog about some of these things because I find them practical, but also because I find them fascinating to think about. The history and technological aspects of these tools are highly interesting subjects that almost never get discussed in detail anymore outside of niche discussions in cultural heritage and digital humanities. Yet, there are entire forums worth of conversations about these subjects that have been going on as long as the internet has had forums.

Speaking of, despite being more involved in memes and their relation to information science and technology research, I've had a strong interest in niche online cultures, tinkering with computer hardware, and open source operating systems. My peers have noticed I have an endearing relationship with half-functioning technologies and reuse of these technologies. My YouTube recommendations today are mostly people talking about ChipTune music, black midi music, and people using the game Line Rider to produce entire music videos. It might make more sense to say that I've always had a hacker-adjacent attitude, as would be expected of anyone from a farm family. Ask any John Deere tractor owner about their position on "right-to-repair" if you don't believe me. You'll find that they are open-source software and hardware advocates. Like me, they tend to believe that things are only broken if they can't access what's wrong. As such, they would be just as quick to say most of our contemporary technologies are broken from the start because you can't tinker with them. As such, many varieties of academic subjects related to hacker culture, open source development, development of networking technologies, technological reuse, simulation/emulation studies, video game studies, and even networked art that extends to histories before the internet have always fascinated me.

I also have a love of fiction. I have a special affinity for all things TRON, Blade Runner, Star Wars, and animation. Speculative fiction is a special interest for me for lots of reasons. As a technological extension to that interest, I also love studying digital art, data art, and art pushing the boundaries between analogue and digital media. Although, it's not all "sci-fi" and "technology" for me. I have spent a little time writing comedic fantasy fiction. While I have not been able to spend as much time doing so, I occasionally get the itch to write comedic fantasy: subtly blending the banal of existential reality into mystically exaggerated absurdities.
