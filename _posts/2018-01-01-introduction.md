# Introduction

I am a PhD candidate of Information Science & Technology at Syracuse University's iSchool. I am an affiliate of Center for Computational and Data Sciences (CCDS). They work for Gravity Spy, the [The Network Influence and Information Curation Lab](https://ischool.syr.edu/research/network-influence-and-information-curation-lab/), and [Metadata Lab](https://ischool.syr.edu/research/metadata-lab/). I have a Masters and Bachelors in Economics from Georgia State University and the University of West Georgia respectively.

My research is closely tied to memetics: the study of memes. In particular they are developing theoretical and methodological lenses to approach evolutionary information of culture, science and technology studies, and cultural heritage and memory studies. Such approaches currently are closing the gaps between the theoretical memetics research that was developing at the start of the 21st century and the datafication processes of Internet Memetics which developed a decade later.

Future research intends to carve out empirically applicable approaches to evolutionary culture within an Information Studies lens as well as a development of principles for documenting, curating, and archiving digitally connected media. Such research requires a datafication project of culture connected to parallel theory development.
